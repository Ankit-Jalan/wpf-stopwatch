## About versioning
    <Major>.<Minor>.<Build>.<Revision>

  * Major releases feature new functions that older versions didn't have.
  * Minor version increments happen when there are significant performance or UI improvements.
  * Build versions are increased with each successful commit which has changes to the code, and can be built.
  * Revisions are quick fixes for builds that don't work as expected or need code clean-up, but have already been committed and pushed.
